<!-- 
to apply padding just type p-range
range varies from 0.5 (2px), 1 (4px) to 96 (384px)
but to apply 1px padding use p-px
in Earlier tailwind version 3 -> their was limitation in range because eg. after 20, 24 then 28 comes
so, if you want to apply p-25 = this wasn't possible, 
thanks to tailwind version 4 -> p-rangeNumber can dynamically generate class based on that ref range

Now classes are dynamically generated, it doesn't care about range limitation anymore

<!-- 
In CSS (and HTML), <h1> is a block-level element by default.

What that means:
It takes up the full width of its parent container.

It forces a line break before and after itself.

You can control its layout easily using block properties like width, margin, padding, etc.


if you alter the property of display to inline in h1
Then it would behave like an inline element (no full-width, no forced new line).


<span> is an inline element by default in HTML and CSS.

What that means:
It does not start on a new line.

It only takes up as much width as its content needs.

It’s mainly used to style small parts of text inside block elements.
-->

<!-- 
on a lighter note, if a person occupies full desk and doesn't let sit anyone in it- he is block

if a junior occupies the desk he lets anyone sits while compromising his comfort.

in  a block elements we have good styling control i.e,  properties like width, height and margin can easily be applied
in an inline its Limited (no width/height unless made inline-block)


You can also force a <span> to behave like a block element using:

    display:block
    it will behave like h1 and div



    Difference between block, inline, inline-block:
block
→ Full width.
→ Forces new line.
→ Can set width, height, padding, margin easily.

inline
→ Flows with text (like words).
→ You cannot set width or height easily.
→ Just good for styling inside sentences.

inline-block
→ Flows like inline (no new line)
→ But you can set width, height, padding, margins like a block!
→ It's a mix of inline's flow + block's styling powers.

Block = Full-width building.
🧵 Inline = Words in a sentence.
🛍️ Inline-block = Little boxes inside a sentence.
