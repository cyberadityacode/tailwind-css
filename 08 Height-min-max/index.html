    <!-- 
    What is h-screen


    h-screen makes the element as tall as the entire screen (browser window).

Even if the page has less content, the element will still take up full height.
    h-screen is great for:

Landing pages

Hero sections

Full-page modals

If you want half screen, you can combine h-1/2 or use custom heights!

Summary:

h-screen = height: 100% of viewport height (100vh) = full screen height

    -->

<!-- to apply height on 50% of the screen -->

<h1 class="bg-pink-300 h-1/2">50% occupancy</h1>

<!-- 
the absolute beauty is that it works stunning on mobile too... 
-->
<h1 class="bg-green-300 h-1/5">20% occupancy</h1>

Difference between h-screen (vh) and dynamic viewport height(h-dvw)

Situation	h-screen (vh)	h-dvw (dvh)
On load	Looks fine	Looks fine
After scroll	Leaves gap at bottom	Perfectly fits screen
ðŸ§  In Short:
h-screen good for desktop and simple pages.

h-dvw awesome for responsive mobile screens, where address bars shift.


Is it safe to use h-dvw on desktop?
Yes! It won't break anything on desktop sites; 
it will behave just like h-screen. 
However, if you want to ensure the elementâ€™s height always adjusts properly 
for both desktop and mobile, you might consider adding fallbacks:

First try using dynamic viewport height
<div class="h-dvw md:h-screen bg-blue-400">
    Content here...
  </div>


  For small screens (mobile), h-dvw will be used (dynamic).

For larger screens (desktop), h-screen will act as a fallback, ensuring the height is stable.

<div class="bg-pink-400 h-10 max-h-50">
    max-height
</div>
<!-- in the below case, h-10 won't work because min height is set to 50 
 but if you set h-70, it will exceed-->
<div class="bg-blue-400 h-10 min-h-50">
    min-height
</div>

<!-- 
h-screen vs h-full

Class	CSS Equivalent	Meaning
h-screen	height: 100vh;	Sets the height of an element to 100% of the viewport height (the visible height of the browser window).
h-full	height: 100%;	Sets the height of an element to 100% of its parentâ€™s height.
